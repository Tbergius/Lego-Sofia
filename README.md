# Lego Club Sofia

Welcome my first project in the Full Stack Developer program. For this project, I imagined an informative site for a local Lego club. The site should show some information, what to do, where to meet, and a contact page. This is all build with HTML and CSS only as this was the primary assignement.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
I went for a palette that reflects the Lego brand colors. These are basics yellow, red, purple, white and black. 

### Typography
I used the Noto sans from Google Fonts as it matches the font used on the Lego site. The text items are short so the clean font should make it easy to read in glance.

### Images
All images are carefully selected to showcase the club's activities and creations, providing an engaging visual experience for visitors.

### Content
The content on the site is created to reflect the particular parts of the site. This was inspired by own experiences and stories/videos from other Lego enthusiasts.

## Wireframes

I do not have a lot of experience yet with making wireframes or creating things from scratch, I did make this mock-up which looked pretty ok! This also gave me a cleared goal on what to do, and where things should go.

## Technology

- HTML - This is the foundation code the website is written in.

- Font Awesone - The icons on the site are taken from here.
- Wepik - I used this AI tool to make the background image for the contact and confirmation page.
- Amiresponsive - For creating the nice picture featured at the start.
- Balsamic - This I used to create the wireframes.
